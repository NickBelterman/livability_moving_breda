# livability_moving_breda
What could the potential factors (within livability) be that influence people moving in a neighbourhood? 

#Problem statement:
VerbeterBreda aims to improve the quality of life and well-being (QoL) of its inhabitants.
Currently QoL places more emphasis on socio-economic indicators. However, climate change affects QoL and its influence is becoming stronger.
To this end, it becomes important to understand the effect of weather and environmental variables on QoL in Breda. ​
